# Coding Practice: Introduction to Loops

This repository contains examples and exercises for practicing loops in C++.

## Examples

1. **Calculate the Sum**: Calculate the sum of even numbers in a given vector using a range-based for loop.
2. **Find the Factorial**: Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.
3. **Guess the Number Game**: Implement a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number using a do-while loop.
 
## Running the Examples

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Execute the `run.sh` script:

    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

This script will compile the `main.cpp` file and execute the resulting executable.

## Sample Run:
```
Your code compiled!! :) Running the program..
The sum of all the even numbers from 1-10 is: 30

Let's find the factorial of a number.
Enter a positive integer: 6
Factorial of 6 is: 720

Guess the number (between 1 and 10): 1
Too low! Try again.
Guess the number (between 1 and 10): 2
Too low! Try again.
Guess the number (between 1 and 10): 3
Too low! Try again.
Guess the number (between 1 and 10): 4
Too low! Try again.
Guess the number (between 1 and 10): 5
Congratulations! You guessed the number.
```
