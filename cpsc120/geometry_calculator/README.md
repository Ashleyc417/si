# Geometry Caclculator Activity
  In this coding activity, we'll be practicing our arithmetic operators by implementing the following functions:
  1. `calculateRectangleArea(double length, double width)`\
  2. `calculateCircleCircumference(double radius)`\
  3. `calculateTrianglePerimeter(double side1, double side2, double side3)`\
  4. `calculateQuotientAndRemainder(int dividend, int divisor)`
  <br />
  
  Lastly, you will be implementing the `main()` function that will test the previous functions you implemented.
  <br />
  <br />

## Compile/Execute Your Code
To compile your code, use the following command: `make build`.\
To execute your code, use the following command: `make test`.

## Expected Output
```
Enter length of the rectangle: 6

Enter length of side 1 of the triangle: 3
Enter length of side 2 of the triangle: 4
Enter length of side 3 of the triangle: 5
Perimeter of the triangle: 12

Enter dividend: 6
Enter divisor: 2
Quotient: 3, Remainder: 0
```
