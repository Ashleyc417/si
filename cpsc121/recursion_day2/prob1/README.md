# Problem 1: Most Frequently Used Character
Given a list of strings, write a function to find the most frequently used character across all the strings. If multiple characters have the same highest frequency, return any one of them.


## Run Your Code:
Run the testing suite script:
> Note: You will only have to run `chmod +x run.sh` once!
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```
This script will compile the `main.cpp` file using either `clang++` or `g++` (depending on availability). If compilation is successful, it will run the testing suite to verify the functionality.

## Example
### Input: 
```
strings = {"hello", "world"}
```

### Output: 
```
Most frequently used character: l
```
