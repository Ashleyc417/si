# Review & Recursion
In today's coding activity we'll be practicing some leetcode type questions along with recursion again. 
There will be three problems for y'all to get through.

## Instructions
1. Start by running the following command:
```bash
mkdir recursion && cd recursion && curl --remote-name-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ashleyc417/si/main/cpsc121/recursion/{prob1/main.cpp,prob1/run.sh,prob1/README.md,prob2/main.cpp,prob2.run.sh,prob2/README.md,prob3/main.cpp,prob3.run.sh,prob3/README.md}
```

2. Then, run `code .` to open VSCode.

3. Start Coding & Complete all the problems!
