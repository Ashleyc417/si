# 📑 Templates & Maps Coding Activity 🗺️ 

Hey everyone, today we're going to be doing a coding activity to help y'all learn templates and maps in C++.

1. To get started run the following the command:

```bash
mkdir -p templates-and-maps/prob1 templates-and-maps/prob2 && touch ./templates-and-maps/{prob1,prob2}/{README.md,main.cpp} && cd ./templates-and-maps/prob1/ && curl --remote-name-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ashleyc417/si/main/cpsc121/templates-and-maps/prob1/{main.cpp,README.md} && cd ../prob2/ && curl --remote-name-all https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ashleyc417/si/main/cpsc121/templates-and-maps/prob2/{main.cpp,README.md} && cd ../../
```

2. Then, run the command `ls` to list your files.

3. Use `cd <directory_name>` to change directories into `templates-and-maps`
  
4. Finally, run the command `code .` to open VSCode and get started on problem 1. Good luck 🙂
