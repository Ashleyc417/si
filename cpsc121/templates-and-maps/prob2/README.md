### Activity 2: Maps (Beginner)

**Objective:** Use a map to track and display the scores of 3 players in a game.  
**Time:** 10 minutes.

#### Problem:

Write a program that uses a map to store player names (strings) as keys and their scores (integers) as values. Display the players and their scores after adding all three.

**Instructions:**

1. Create a `map<string, int>` to store player names and their scores.
2. Insert 3 players into the map with their respective scores.
3. Use a loop to display each player's name and score.

**Players and Scores:**

- "Alice" -> 50
- "Bob" -> 75
- "Charlie" -> 60

**Expected Output:**

```cpp
Alice: 50
Bob: 75
Charlie: 60
```
